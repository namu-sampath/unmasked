# Unmasked: The Unveiling of Serial Killers
This is a repository about the 712 identified serial killers who terrorized victims across the United States dating back to the 1700s. 

## What I aimed to accomplish
I wanted to learn if there are any states in the U.S. with a "common ground" for serial killers, whether many serial killers met their demise the same way as each other, and what the largest targeted population of victims has been. 

## My findings
California is most affected state, with 65 identified cases of serial killers taking the lives of their victims. The 'Golden State' is in the lead by a far comparison to the others that follow in its footsteps: New York, Florida and Texas. Mostly, this makes sense, as these are among the largest states in the country. The states with the least amount of identified serial killers in the region were South Dakota, Vermont and Hawaii. Perhaps because of their size or because the killers have not been identified for this dataset, South Dakota and Vermont both come in with zero victims of a serial killer in this analysis. 

## Data collection process
I set out to use an HTML scraper to better understand the data I was working with. As I started to scrape my data, I learned that there were two tables on the page I wanted to scrape. Additionally, there were no table captions that could help me identify what to type in my code. As a result, I ended up using Pandas to do the rest of my analysis. I wanted to better understand whether there are any hotspots for homicide, if one gender kills more than others (I was not able to gather this information), whether the serial killers themselves had similarities in their status post-crimes (e.g. incarcerated, died naturally, was killed somehow, etc.)

I used the first table from [this Wikipedia site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_serial_killers_in_the_United_States#Identified_serial_killers) for this project.

## New skills, what I learned
For this project, I really wanted to try doing a D3 interactive graph for the hotspots so that readers could explore the states that are the common ground for serial killers. I think that might have been an interesting way to explore the data. Unfortunately, I did not have the time to turn something around quickly, but this is something I hope to do for the next project. 

As for what I tried that was new â€” using HTML scraping to better understand the website I was trying to analyze was a learning curve. It made me think outside the box for ways I could approach my data. In the future, I would like to do a side-bar to this story, solely focusing on the victims of these crimes with scrollytelling for readers.
